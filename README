img2xterm

A program which can convert bitmap images to a series of control sequences and
block characters suitable for display on many popular 256-color terminal
emulators, including xterm, rxvt-unicode and GNU Screen.

Inspration was taken from the img2cow software available here:

http://srsfckn.biz/cows/img2cow.c

This software could take a bitmap image and convert it to a .cow file, suitable
for use in cowsay and cowthink. img2xterm is a complete rewrite of img2cow. It
aims to improve upon the color selection and block printing algorithms used in
img2cow, while providing more generic output, without the header and footer
required for use in cowsay (although this functionality is provided by the
img2cow script here, which replicates the behaviour of the old program.) The
basis for the new color conversion algorithm was taken from Wolfgang Frisch's
(xororand@frexx.de) xterm256-conv, available here:

Although modification was required to remove the first 16 colors (as they vary
from term to term and are normally user configurable) and fix the range of the
grey ramp.

To install, simply run:
make
sudo make install

To display an image on a compatible 256-color terminal:
img2xterm image.png

To generate a cowfile:
img2cow image.png > image.cow
sudo cp image.cow /usr/share/cows

A GIMP palette containing the upper 240 colors used in xterm is also available
and can be used for dithering images before conversion. Install with:
cd extra/
make
cp xterm-256color.gpl ~/.gimp-2.6/palettes/
